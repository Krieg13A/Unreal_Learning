# Unreal_Learning
I'm learning Unreal Engine with C++ on my own. This repo tracks my progress and experiments. Feedback and help are always welcome.

For now, I haven’t learned anything worth showing in a screenshot.
Today I explored how to change materials (roughness, color, etc.) and lights (color, intensity, etc.).
Tomorrow I’ll start working on some animations and basic mechanics.
