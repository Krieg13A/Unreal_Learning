# Unreal Learning

This repository documents my personal learning progress with Unreal Engine 5 and C++.

## What is this?
I'm a Computer Science student exploring game development on my own.  
Here you'll find:
- My development logs (see `progress_log.md`)
- Simple projects or mechanics built in Unreal
- Notes, learnings, and practice tests as I go

## Tools & Technologies
- Unreal Engine 5.2
- C++
- Blueprints
- Git & GitHub

## Goals
- Learn how to use Unreal with C++ efficiently
- Build a personal gameplay prototype or editor tool
- Apply to studios like Embark in the near future
